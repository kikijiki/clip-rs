# CLIP-RS

A very rough implementation of [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP/blob/main/clip/model.py) ([weights](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14)) by OpenAI using the [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/) framework.

> [!NOTE]
> While I was working on this, CLIP got officially added to Candle, so there is no reason to use this library.
